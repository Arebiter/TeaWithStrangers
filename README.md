Signed in users are able to create tea time events and also edit those events. The changes to the tea times update in real time.

## Future Features
### User Reviews
I want to give users the ability to review the tea times they have attended. The host of the tea time will receive those reviews on their profile and the reviews will be accessible by other people. 

### Google Maps
I want to give the users a way to more precisely determine the location of a tea time. Using the google maps api, users will be able to point to exactly where they want to meet instead of vague locations and instructions
